> This project uses the least square classifier to recognize image based digits and evaluating its performance


## Description
The requirement is to design a least squares-based classification algorithm that can recognize scanned images of the 10 digits (0 to 9) provided in the files “Train & Test”. The “Train” folder contains 240 images for each digit, while the “Test” folder contains 20 images for each digit. The images in the
“Train” folder is used to train a classifier for each digit using the Least Square Classifier. The folder contains a file named “Training Labels.txt”
which includes the labels of the 2400 images in order. After the classifiers are trained, test each classifier using the images given in the “Test” folder. The folder also contains a text file named “Test Labels.txt” which include the labels of the 200 images in order.
