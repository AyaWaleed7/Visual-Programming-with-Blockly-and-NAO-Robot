# Visual-Programming-with-Blockly-and-NAO-Robot


> This project uses the Block based programming to control Nao Robot.


## Description
The aim of this project is to integrate the robotics with education and teaching children
computational thinking and programming concepts. Block-based visual
programming language will be used to develop a web interface that will control an interactive
humanoid robots. The target of the project is to test if using a humanoid
interactive robot while teaching children programming will effect their learning gain in
understanding programming concepts. Another aim is to measure the engagement level
when using a humanoid interactive robot (NAO robot) in teaching versus learning on
multimedia devices.
## Installation
